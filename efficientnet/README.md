# EfficientNet: Low-Power, Low-Latency Image Classification in the Browser

EfficientNets are a family of low-power, low-latency image classification models designed to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.

This TensorFlow.js model does not require you to know about machine learning.
It can take as input any browser-based image elements (`<img>`, `<video>`, `<canvas>`
elements, for example) and returns an array of most likely predictions and
their confidences.
