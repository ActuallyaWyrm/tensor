# KNN Classifier

This package provides a utility for creating a classifier using the
[K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)
algorithm.

This package is different from the other packages in this repository in that it
doesn't provide a model with weights, but rather a utility for constructing a
model another models for embeddings.
