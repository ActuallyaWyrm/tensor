# Demos

Try various of our demos and models and get inspired with what you can do with
pose-detection models!

## Live camera
This demo uses your camera to get live stream and tracks your poses in real-time.
You can change different models, runtimes and backends to see the difference. It
works on laptops, iPhones and android phones.
