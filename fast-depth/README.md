# FastDepth
Note: this model can only detect a maximum of one hand in the input - multi-hand detection is coming in a future release.

FastDepth is a lightweight model capable of infering depth.

# Performance

FastDepth consists of ~5MB of weights, and is well-suited for real time inference across a variety of devices (TODO: add fps per devices).

## Installation

Using `yarn`:

    $ yarn add @tensorflow-models/fast-depth

Using `npm`:

    $ npm install @tensorflow-models/fast-depth

Note that this package specifies `@tensorflow/tfjs-core` and `@tensorflow/tfjs-converter` as peer dependencies, so they will also need to be installed.

## Usage

To import in npm:

```js
//TODO: add node import
```

or as a standalone script tag:

```html
//TODO: add html import
```
